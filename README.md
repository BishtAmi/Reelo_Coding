Steps:
Create a Project Directory:

Create a new directory for your project. 
Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you want to create your project, and run:

mkdir Reelo
cd Reelo

Initialize Node.js Project:

Inside your project directory, run the following command to initialize a package.json file:

npm init -y

Install Required Node Modules:
Install the required Node modules (dependencies) using the following command:

npm install fs

Create index.js File:

Create a file named index.js in your project directory.
Copy and Paste Code:

Copy the code you want to run and paste it into the index.js file.
Run the Code:

In the terminal or command prompt, run the following command to execute the index.js file using Node.js:

node index.js

This will run your JavaScript code, and you should see the output in the console.
Notes:
Make sure that the questions.json file is in the same directory as your index.js file, or adjust the file path accordingly in the code.
You can use any text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to create and edit your index.js file (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text, etc.).
By following these steps, you'll be able to set up and run the provided code in your IDE.
